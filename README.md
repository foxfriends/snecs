# Snecs

Entity-Component-System based off [Specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs), but
for NodeJS (__S__necs __N__ode __ECS__, if you will). Due to Javascript's inherent
single-threadedness, we naturally drop the "parallel" aspect, but keep the interface
and concepts similar.

Someday (given outside interest, or inside free time) I will document this project.
Until then, refer to the [Specs Tutorial](https://specs.amethyst.rs/docs/tutorials/)
for instructions better than I could ever create. You'll find using Snecs remarkably
similar.
